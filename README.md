# Hw4ZhuChen

a demo code for Mr. Zhu CHEN.
I wrote this demo code for his homework of the course *Machine Learnig* (Nov 2018, 3rd Lecture).
I pushed the demo to my GitHub because it contains several useful methods (written by myself) & a complete process about SVO model:
1. a method & corresponding stop-word list to do English word segementation
2. a method to quickly compute TF-IDF
3. a method to do fast sampling for n-fold cross-validation
4. a demo of the idea/philosophy that "say no to numpy & pandas"; I use standard/built-in libraries & data structures to do computing

This demo may be a good example for programming beginners and those "package callers" (a clean style of programming & algorithm design! :) )
